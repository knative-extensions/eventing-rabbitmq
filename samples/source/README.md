# RabbitMQ Knative Eventing Source Example

## Prerequisites

Same as listed [here](../../source/README.md#prerequisites)

## Overview

This demo will use a RabbitMQ Source to fetch messages from a RabbitMQ Exchange, convert them into [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) and send them to a [Sink](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/sinks/#about-sinks). The complete list of the Source's config parameters are shown [here](../../source/README.md)

## Components

- [perf-test](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-perf-test) RabbitMQ has a throughput testing tool, PerfTest, that is based on the Java client and can be configured to simulate basic to advanced workloads of messages sent to a RabbitMQ Cluster.

- [event-display](https://github.com/knative/eventing/tree/main/cmd/event_display)
  which is a tool that logs the CloudEvent that it receives formatted nicely.

- [RabbitMQ Source](../../source/README.md)

## Configuration

Demo creates a `PerfTest` and has it executes a loop where it send 1 event per second for 30 seconds, and then no events for 30 seconds to the `RabbitMQ Cluster Exchange` called `eventing-rabbitmq-source`, created by the `RabbitMQ Source`.

Demo creates a `Source` with and exchange configuration for it to read messages from the `eventing-rabbitmq-source` `Exchange` and to send them to the `event-display` `sink` after the translation to CloudEvents.

## Steps

### Create a namespace

Create a new namespace for the demo. All the commands are expected to be
executed from the root of this repo.

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/source/100-namespace.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl create ns source-demo
```

### Create a RabbitMQ Cluster

Create a RabbitMQ Cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/source/200-rabbitmq.yaml
```
or
```
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: rabbitmq.com/v1beta1
kind: RabbitmqCluster
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq
  namespace: source-demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
EOF
```

### Create the Perf Test Service

This will create a Kubernetes Deployment which sends events to the RabbitMQ Cluster Exchange

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/source/300-perf-test.yaml
```

Messages from the `rabbitmq-perf-test` deployment won't reach the RabbitMQ Cluster until the Source is created, which results in the creation of the Exchange and Queue where the messages are going to be sent

### Create the RabbitMQ Source's Sink

Then create the Knative Serving Service which will receive translated events.

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/source/400-sink.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-display
  namespace: source-demo
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/knative-releases/knative.dev/eventing/cmd/event_display
EOF
```

### Create the RabbitMQ Source

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/source/500-source.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: RabbitmqSource
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq-source
  namespace: source-demo
spec:
  brokers: "rabbitmq:5672/"
  topic: ""
  user:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: rabbitmq-default-user
      key: username
  password:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: rabbitmq-default-user
      key: password
  channelConfig:
    globalQos: false
  exchangeConfig:
    name: "eventing-rabbitmq-source"
    type: "fanout"
    durable: false
    autoDelete: false
    internal: false
    nowait: false
  queueConfig:
    name: "eventing-rabbitmq-source"
    routingKey: ""
    durable: false
    autoDelete: true
    exclusive: true
    nowait: false
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: rabbitmq-source-sink
      namespace: source-demo
EOF
```

### Check the results

Check the rabbitmq-source-sink (the Dead Letter Sink) to see if it is receiving events.
It may take a while for the Source to start sending events to the Sink, so be patient :p!

```sh
kubectl -n source-demo -l='serving.knative.dev/service=rabbitmq-source-sink' logs -c user-container
