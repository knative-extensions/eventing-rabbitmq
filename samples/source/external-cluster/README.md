# RabbitMQ Knative Eventing Source Example

## Prerequisites

- Same as listed [here](../../../docs/source.md#prerequisites)
- A working RabbitMQ external instance exposed via an accessible IP/URL, an example on how to setup this can be found [here](./resources/rabbitmq.yml)
- An RabbitMQ `Exchange` called `eventing-rabbitmq-source`, `Queue` called `eventing-rabbitmq-source` and `Binding` between both already declared

Note: An external RabbitMQ instance can be used, but if you want to use the `Source` without predeclared resources (specifically the `Exchange`, `Binding` and `Queue`), the `RabbitMQ Message Topology Operator` needs to be installed in the same Kubernetes Cluster as the `Source`.

## Overview

This demo will use a RabbitMQ Source to fetch messages from a RabbitMQ Exchange, convert them into [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) and send them to a [Sink](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/sinks/#about-sinks). The complete list of the Source's config parameters are shown [here](../../../docs/source.md)

## Components

- [perf-test](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-perf-test) RabbitMQ has a throughput testing tool, PerfTest, that is based on the Java client and can be configured to simulate basic to advanced workloads of messages sent to a RabbitMQ Cluster. More info about the perf-test testing tool can be found [here](../perf-test.help.env.text)

- [event-display](https://github.com/knative/eventing/tree/main/cmd/event_display)
  which is a tool that logs the CloudEvent that it receives formatted nicely.

- [RabbitMQ Source](../../../docs/source.md)

## Configuration

Demo creates a `PerfTest` and has it executes a loop where it sends 1 event per second for 30 seconds, and then no events for 30 seconds to the `RabbitMQ Cluster Exchange` called `eventing-rabbitmq-source` predeclared by the user.

Demo creates a `Source` to read messages from the `eventing-rabbitmq-source` `Exchange` and to send them to the `event-display` `sink` after the translation to CloudEvents.

## Steps

### Create a namespace

Create a new namespace for the demo. All the commands are expected to be
executed from the root of this repo.

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/source/external-cluster/100-namespace.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl create ns source-demo
```

### Add RabbitMQ http uri to secret

Add the RabbitMQ http uri to its default user secret. Important: if you have different IPs/URLs for the RabbitMQ's management UI and the RabbitMQ's connection port, use the Management UI URL here and the connection port URL in the yamls.
The RabbitMQ default user credentials are stored in a Kubernetes secret called '$NAME-default-user', where $NAME is the name of the RabbitmqCluster object.
In this example, the secret name is 'rabbitmq-default-user' in namespace 'source-demo'.

Create and Edit the RabbitMQ default user secret as explained [here](../quick-setup/README.md#add-rabbitmq-http-uri-to-secret)

### Create the Perf Test Service

This will create a Kubernetes Deployment which sends events to the RabbitMQ Cluster Exchange

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/source/external-cluster/200-perf-test.yaml
```

Messages from the `rabbitmq-perf-test`

### Create the RabbitMQ Source's Sink

Then create the Knative Serving Service which will receive translated events.

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/source/external-cluster/300-sink.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-display
  namespace: source-demo
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/knative-releases/knative.dev/eventing/cmd/event_display
EOF
```

### Create the RabbitMQ Source

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/source/external-cluster/500-source.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: RabbitmqSource
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq-source
  namespace: source-demo
spec:
  broker: "$YOUR_RABBITMQ_IP/URL:5672/"
  user:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: rabbitmq-default-user
      key: username
  password:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: rabbitmq-default-user
      key: password
  predeclared: true # For this to be false, the Topology Operator must be installed in your Source's cluster
  # https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/using-topology-operator.html
  channelConfig:
    globalQos: false
  exchangeConfig:
    name: "eventing-rabbitmq-source"
  queueConfig:
    name: "eventing-rabbitmq-source"
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: rabbitmq-source-sink
      namespace: source-demo
```

### Check the results

Check the rabbitmq-source-sink (the Dead Letter Sink) to see if it is receiving events.
It may take a while for the Source to start sending events to the Sink, so be patient :p!

```sh
kubectl -n source-demo -l='serving.knative.dev/service=rabbitmq-source-sink' logs -c user-container
