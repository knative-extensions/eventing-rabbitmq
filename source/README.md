# RabbitMQ Source

The RabbitMQ source translates messages on a RabbitMQ exchange to CloudEvents
based on the [RabbitMQ Protocol Binding for CloudEvents Spec](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-rabbitmq/blob/main/cloudevents-protocol-spec/spec.md),
which can then be used with Knative Eventing over HTTP. The source can bind to
an existing RabbitMQ exchange, or create a new exchange if required.

## Prerequisites

* Follow the [Operator based Broker's Prerequisites Section](../broker/operator-based.md#prerequisites)

* Before we can create the Knative Eventing Source, we first need to create a RabbitMQ Cluster:

```shell
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: rabbitmq.com/v1beta1
kind: RabbitmqCluster
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
EOF
```

## Installation

You can install the latest released version of the [Knative RabbitMQ Source](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-rabbitmq/releases/):

```shell
kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-rabbitmq/releases/latest/download/rabbitmq-source.yaml
```

If you wanted to install a specific version, e.g. v0.25.0, you can run:

```shell
kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-rabbitmq/releases/download/v0.25.0/rabbitmq-source.yaml
```

You can install a nightly version:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/knative-nightly/eventing-rabbitmq/latest/rabbitmq-source.yaml
```

Or if you want to run the latest version from this repo, you can use [`ko`](https://github.com/google/ko) to install it.

- Install the `ko` CLI for building and deploying purposes.

   ```shell script
   go get github.com/google/go-containerregistry/cmd/ko
   ```

- Configure container registry, such as a Docker Hub account, is required.

- Export the `KO_DOCKER_REPO` environment variable with a value denoting the
   container registry to use.

   ```shell script
   export KO_DOCKER_REPO="docker.io/YOUR_REPO"
   ```
- Install the source operator
   ```
   ko apply -f config/source/
   ```

Now you can create a RabbitMQ source in the default namespace running:
```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: RabbitmqSource
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq-source
spec:
  brokers: "rabbitmq:5672/"
  user:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: rabbitmq-default-user
      key: username
  password:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: rabbitmq-default-user
      key: password
  channelConfig:
    globalQos: false
  exchangeConfig:
    name: "eventing-rabbitmq-source"
    type: "fanout"
  queueConfig:
    name: "eventing-rabbitmq-source"
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: rabbitmq-source-sink
      namespace: source-demo
EOF
```

## Published Events

All messages received by the source are published with the following schema:

Event attributes
| Attribute | Value  | Notes  |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `type` | `dev.knative.rabbitmq.event` | |
| `source` | `/apis/v1/namespace/*$NS*/rabbitmqsources/*$NAME*#*$TOPIC*` | `NS`, `NAME` and `TOPIC` are derived from the source configuration |
| `id` | A unique ID | This uses the `MessageId` if available, and a UUID otherwise |
| `subject` | The ID of the message | Empty string if no message ID is present |
| `datacontenttype` | `application/json` | Currently static |
| `key` | The ID of the message | Empty string if no message ID is present |

The payload of the event is set to the data content of the message.

## Samples

For a message published with the payload "Hello rabbitmq!", for example with
[`rabbitmqadmin`](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management-cli.html):

```sh
rabbitmqadmin publish exchange=amq.default payload="Hello rabbitmq!"
```

The source sends the following event content:

.CloudEvents JSON format

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "type": "dev.knative.rabbitmq.event",
  "source": "/apis/v1/namespaces/default/rabbitmqsources/rabbitmq-source",
  "id": "f00c1f52-33a1-4d3d-993f-750f20c804da",
  "time": "2020-12-18T01:15:20.450860898Z",
  "subject": "",
  "datacontenttype": "application/json",
  "key": "",
  "data": "Hello rabbitmq!"
}
```

## Creating and Managing Sources

Sources are Kubernetes objects. In addition to the standard Kubernetes
`apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata`, they have the following `spec` fields:

Source parameters
| Field  | Value  |
|--------|--------|
| `spec.brokers` | Host+Port of the Broker, with a trailing "/" |
| `spec.vhost` * | VHost where the source resources are located |
| `spec.predeclared` | Defines if the source should try to create new queue or use predeclared one (Boolean) |
| `user.secretKeyRef` | Username for Broker authentication; field `key` in a Kubernetes Secret named `name` |
| `password.secretKeyRef` | Password for Broker authentication; field `key` in a Kubernetes Secret named `name` |
| `topic` | The topic for the exchange |
| `exchangeConfig` | Settings for the exchange |
| `exchangeConfig.type` | [Exchange type](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html#exchanges). Can be `fanout`, `direct`, `topic`, `match` or `headers` |
| `exchangeConfig.durable` * | Boolean |
| `exchangeConfig.autoDelete` * | Boolean |
| `exchangeConfig.internal` * | Boolean |
| `exchangeConfig.nowait` * | Boolean |
| `queueConfig` * | Settings for the queue |
| `queueConfig.name` * | Name of the queue (may be empty) |
| `queueConfig.routingKey` * | Routing key for the queue |
| `queueConfig.durable` * | Boolean |
| `queueConfig.autoDelete` * | Boolean |
| `queueConfig.exclusive` * | Boolean |
| `queueConfig.nowait` * | Boolean |
| `channelConfig.parallelism` * | Int that sets the [Consumer Prefetch Value](https://www.rabbitmq.com/consumer-prefetch.html) and creates `n` parallel consumer processes. Default value is `1`. Value must be between `1` and `1000`. With a value of `1` the RabbitMQ Source process events in FIFO order, values above `1` break message ordering guarantees and can be seen as more performance oriented. |
| `channelConfig.globalQos` * | Boolean defining how the [Consumer Sharing Limit](https://www.rabbitmq.com/consumer-prefetch.html#sharing-the-limit) is handled. |
| `sink` | A reference to an [Addressable](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/#event-consumers) Kubernetes object |

`*` These attributes are optional.

You will need a Kubernetes Secret to hold the RabbitMQ username and
password. The following command is one way to create a secret with the username
`rabbit-user` and the password taken from the `/tmp/password` file.

```sh
kubectl create secret generic rabbitmq-secret \
  --from-literal=user=rabbit-user \
  --from-file=password=/tmp/password
```

Note that many parameters do not need to be specified. Unspecified optional
parameters will be defaulted to `false` or `""` (empty string).

```yaml
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: RabbitmqSource
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq-source
spec:
  brokers: "rabbitmq:5672/"
  user:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: "rabbitmq-secret"
      key: "user"
  password:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: "rabbitmq-secret"
      key: "password"
  exchangeConfig:
    type: "fanout"
    durable: true
    autoDelete: false
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display
```

The Source will provide output information about readiness or errors via the
`status` field on the object once it has been created in the cluster.

### Configuration Options

- Event source parameters.

  - Configure channel config properties based on this documentation.

    ```
    1. Qos controls how many messages or how many bytes the server will try to keep on
    the network for consumers before receiving delivery acks.  The intent of Qos is
    to make sure the network buffers stay full between the server and client.

    2. With a parallelism greater than zero, the server will deliver that many
    messages to consumers before acknowledgments are received.  The server ignores
    this option when consumers are started with noAck because no acknowledgments
    are expected or sent.

    3. When global is true, these Qos settings apply to all existing and future
    consumers on all channels on the same connection.  When false, the Channel.Qos
    settings will apply to all existing and future consumers on this channel.

    4. Please see the RabbitMQ Consumer Prefetch documentation for an explanation of
    how the global flag is implemented in RabbitMQ, as it differs from the
    AMQP 0.9.1 specification in that global Qos settings are limited in scope to
    channels, not connections (https://www.rabbitmq.com/consumer-prefetch.html).

    5. To get round-robin behavior between consumers consuming from the same queue on
    different connections, set the parallelism to 1, and the next available
    message on the server will be delivered to the next available consumer.

    6. If your consumer work time is reasonably consistent and not much greater
    than two times your network round trip time, you will see significant
    throughput improvements starting with a prallelism of 2 or slightly
    greater as described by benchmarks on RabbitMQ.

    7. http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2012/04/25/rabbitmq-performance-measurements-part-2/
    ```

  - Configure exchange config properties based on this documentation.

    ```
    1. Exchange names starting with "amq." are reserved for pre-declared and
    standardized exchanges. The client MAY declare an exchange starting with
    "amq." if the passive option is set, or the exchange already exists.  Names can
    consist of a non-empty sequence of letters, digits, hyphen, underscore,
    period, or colon.

    2. Each exchange belongs to one of a set of exchange kinds/types implemented by
    the server. The exchange types define the functionality of the exchange - i.e.
    how messages are routed through it. Once an exchange is declared, its type
    cannot be changed.  The common types are "direct", "fanout", "topic" and
    "headers".

    3. Durable and Non-Auto-Deleted exchanges will survive server restarts and remain
    declared when there are no remaining bindings.  This is the best lifetime for
    long-lived exchange configurations like stable routes and default exchanges.

    4. Non-Durable and Auto-Deleted exchanges will be deleted when there are no
    remaining bindings and not restored on server restart.  This lifetime is
    useful for temporary topologies that should not pollute the virtual host on
    failure or after the consumers have completed.

    5. Non-Durable and Non-Auto-deleted exchanges will remain as long as the server is
    running including when there are no remaining bindings.  This is useful for
    temporary topologies that may have long delays between bindings.

    6. Durable and Auto-Deleted exchanges will survive server restarts and will be
    removed before and after server restarts when there are no remaining bindings.
    These exchanges are useful for robust temporary topologies or when you require
    binding durable queues to auto-deleted exchanges.

    7. Note: RabbitMQ declares the default exchange types like 'amq.fanout' as
    durable, so queues that bind to these pre-declared exchanges must also be
    durable.

    8. Exchanges declared as `internal` do not accept accept publishings. Internal
    exchanges are useful when you wish to implement inter-exchange topologies
    that should not be exposed to users of the broker.

    9. When noWait is true, declare without waiting for a confirmation from the server.
    The channel may be closed as a result of an error.  Add a NotifyClose listener
    to respond to any exceptions.

    10. Optional amqp.Table of arguments that are specific to the server's implementation of
    the exchange can be sent for exchange types that require extra parameters.
    ```

  - Configure queue config properties based on this documentation.

    ```
    1. The queue name may be empty, in which case the server will generate a unique name
    which will be returned in the Name field of Queue struct.

    2. Durable and Non-Auto-Deleted queues will survive server restarts and remain
    when there are no remaining consumers or bindings.  Persistent publishings will
    be restored in this queue on server restart.  These queues are only able to be
    bound to durable exchanges.

    3. Non-Durable and Auto-Deleted queues will not be redeclared on server restart
    and will be deleted by the server after a short time when the last consumer is
    canceled or the last consumer's channel is closed.  Queues with this lifetime
    can also be deleted normally with QueueDelete.  These durable queues can only
    be bound to non-durable exchanges.

    4. Non-Durable and Non-Auto-Deleted queues will remain declared as long as the
    server is running regardless of how many consumers.  This lifetime is useful
    for temporary topologies that may have long delays between consumer activity.
    These queues can only be bound to non-durable exchanges.

    5. Durable and Auto-Deleted queues will be restored on server restart, but without
    active consumers will not survive and be removed.  This Lifetime is unlikely
    to be useful.

    6. Exclusive queues are only accessible by the connection that declares them and
    will be deleted when the connection closes.  Channels on other connections
    will receive an error when attempting  to declare, bind, consume, purge or
    delete a queue with the same name.

    7. When noWait is true, the queue will assume to be declared on the server.  A
    channel exception will arrive if the conditions are met for existing queues
    or attempting to modify an existing queue from a different connection.
